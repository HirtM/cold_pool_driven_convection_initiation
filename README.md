# cold_pool_driven_convection_initiation
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the plots in the following puplication:

Hirt, M., Craig, G. C., Sch√§fer, S., Savre, J., & Heinze, R. (2019). Cold pool
driven convective initiation: using causal graph analysis to determine what convection permitting models are missing. Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, under review.

Plots for RQ1 + RQ2 are in the first notebook, linear causal graph analysis (RQ3) is in the second notebook. 

Data relevant for this repository is based on the HDCP2 ICON-LEM simulations (http://hdcp2.eu/index.php?id=5013&L=276). The postprocessed data will be made available by https://data.ub.uni-muenchen.de/.
